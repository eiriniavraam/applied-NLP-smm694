## Overview

In week 4, the attention revolves around topic modeling, a popular technique to
discover hidden themes in text corpora.

Specifically, we pursue three learning goals:

- Appreciating the various steps for a topic modeling project
- Familiarizing with the scope of applications for topic models
- Evaluating alternative topic models specifications against a variety of fit  
  metrics
