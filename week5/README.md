## Overview

In this session, the attention revolves around `sentiment analysis,' a technique
that turns be very effective in measuring audiences' reactions _vis a' vis_
ideas, opinions, marketing campaigns, or offerings

Specifically, we pursue three learning goals:
- Appreciating the various steps for a sentiment analysis project
- Learning to train different types of sentiment analysis classifiers
- Generalizing the sentiment classifier to consider any meaningful continuum
