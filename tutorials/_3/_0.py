Notes: Appreciating the approximate or phonetic distance between two string
       is a common task when it comes to manipulate strings. The jellyfish
       library for Python implements several distance metrics.

       One of the metrics available in the jellyfish library is the 
       Levenshtein Distance / Minimum Edit Distance, the number of insertions, 
       deletions, and substitutions required to change one word to another.

       One possible application
       is identifying successful patch/code submissions on the part of 
       developers or data scientists working in a team setting 
       (e.g., GitHub teams). For example, the members of the Linux Kernel 
       community exchange their code using the mailing list of the project, 
       while very few members have the power to accept (i.e., to commit)
       a patch/code submissions. This raises concerns on who contributed
       to what and to what extent.

       This script applies the Levensthein Distance/Minimum Edit Distance to
       appreciate the similarity between some code included in a fictional email
       and the commit that is visible in a fictional, reference repository.

'''
Conclusion:

+ the comparison of s1 and s2 clearly indicates Homer contributed
  to the project as per the commit that is visible in the colalborative repo.

+ the comparison of s1 and s3 raises some concerns â€• if you don't observe
  any Homer's commits to the collaborative repo (because he doesn't own
  the repo) it could be hard to affirm Homer made a contribution.
