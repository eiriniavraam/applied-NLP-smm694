Tutorial 3 â€• README
===================

This tutorial deals with the following topics:

+ string similarity
+ manipulation of word vectors

The [jellyfish][1] library is **required** to reproduce the tutorial.

Appreciating the approximate or phonetic distance between two string is a common
task when it comes to manipulate strings. The jellyfish library for Python
implements several distance metrics.

One of the metrics available in the jellyfish library is the Levenshtein
Distance / Minimum Edit Distance, the number of insertions, deletions, and
substitutions required to change one word to another.

One possible application is identifying successful patch/code submissions on the
part of developers or data scientists working in a team setting (e.g., GitHub
teams). For example, the members of the Linux Kernel community exchange their
code using the mailing list of the project, while very few members have the
power to accept (i.e., to commit) a patch/code submissions. This raises concerns
on who contributed to what and to what extent.

This script applies the Levensthein Distance/Minimum Edit Distance to appreciate
the similarity between some code included in a fictional email and the commit
that is visible in a fictional, reference repository.
