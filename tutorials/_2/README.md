Tutorial 2 â€• README
===================

This tutorial deals with the following topics:

+ word vectors
+ manipulation of word vectors

NumPy, Scipy, Gensim, and Matplolib are **required** to reproduce the tutorial.

The Python script shows how to:

1. load word vectors from a pre-trained model

2. fetch the word vectors associated with target entities

3. compute the distance between any two vectors (that is, their
   semantic (dis-)similarity)

4. visually represent cosine similarity scores concerning a set of
   entities
