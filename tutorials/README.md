Tutorials â€• README
==================

Below is the set of tutorials students may want to go through to fix some core 
ideas discussed in the online videos/tutorials. The large majority of tutorials
also offer some basic NLP recipes that may be useful for future projects.
(I'll continue to update this as the module progresses; keep an eye on it.)
