Tutorial 4 â€• README
===================

This tutorial deals with the following topics:

+ word vectors
+ manipulation of word vectors
+ statistical post-processing of word vectors

NumPy, Gensim, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib are **required*** libraries to 
reproduce the tutorial.

This Python script illustrates how:

1. to load word vectors from a pre-trained model

2. to fetch the word vectors associated with target entities

3. to sample 'alter' words, i.e., words that are in the neighborhood
   of a target vector

4. to fetch the word vectors associated with alter words

5. to use dimensionality reduction techniques to explore the semantic
   similarity across target and alter words
